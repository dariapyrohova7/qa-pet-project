## 📌 Project Description

The project includes QA documentation created for both **training purposes** and **real websites**.

---

### 🔹 Training Documentation

Folders marked as **Training** contain documentation created for a training website or application.

**PetMedia** is a **fictional application** designed specifically for practicing:
- user stories and use cases
- test case creation
- functional and non-functional testing
- application of Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

Training checklists were created at the time when the training website was accessible.  
Currently, access to the website is restricted. These documents are kept as learning artifacts to demonstrate test design skills.

### 🔹 Real Websites

The repository also contains test documentation and bug reports created while testing **real websites**, including:
- local Ukrainian websites
- local Danish website
- international website

📌 **Note:**  
Test cases and checklist created for **Makeup.dk** can also be applied to **Makeup.ua**, as both websites have an identical interface and functionality.
